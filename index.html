    <h2>What is Ocean????</h2>
<p>The Earth's surface is predominantly covered by the ocean, accounting for 70 percent of it. 
    This vast body of water comprises <br>roughly 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (equivalent 
    to 324 million cubic miles), representing approximately 97 percent of the total <br>water 
    found on our planet. It is the ocean that sustains all life on Earth and gives our planet 
    its distinctive blue appearance when 
<br>observed from outer space. Among the celestial bodies in our solar system, Earth stands 
alone as the only one confirmed to possess <br>liquid water.</p>

    <p class="text">The ocean is the largest reservoir of carbon in the world. Phytoplankton 
        take part in photosynthesis and, thus, help with carbon sequestration. In turn, they release oxygen.</p>

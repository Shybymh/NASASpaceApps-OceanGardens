          <p id="indexP">The Earth's surface is predominantly covered by the ocean, accounting for 70 percent of it.
            This
            vast body of water comprises <br>roughly <b>1.35 billion cubic kilometers</b> (equivalent to 324 million
            cubic
            miles), representing approximately 97 percent of the total <br>water found on our planet. It is the ocean
            that
            sustains all life on Earth and gives our planet its distinctive blue appearance when
            <br>observed from outer space. Among the celestial bodies in our solar system, Earth stands alone as the
            only
            one confirmed to possess <br>liquid water.

            <p class="text">The ocean is the largest reservoir of carbon in the world. <b>Phytoplankton</b> take part in
              photosynthesis and, thus, help with carbon sequestration. In turn, they release oxygen.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>1. Did you know? What we currently know about the ocean is nothing but a small information compared to the
          vastness of what's unknown. In fact, it's said that only <b>10% of the world's oceans</b> have been mapped,
          and because of this, the amount of sea creatures discovered is also extremely small! Think of all the
          creatures living in the parts of the ocean not yet discovered, maybe you could be the one to discover them
          all! <br><br><br>2. According to studies, if all the ice in the world melted, the sea levels would rise by
          about <b>70 meters!</b> It would be as high as the Statue of Liberty! <br><br><br>3. As surprising as it
          sounds, thanks to oceans most of our planet is dark! In fact, despite what we see everyday, the sea levels
          reach up to <b>12,100 feet deep</b>, and light naturally doesn't get that far underwater. Since our world is
          made up mainly of oceans, this means we are more likely to be in a very dark place than under a bright light!

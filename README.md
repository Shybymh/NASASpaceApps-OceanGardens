# NASASpaceApps-OceanGardens

This repository is for a website made for NASA SpaceApps Hackathon. Our challenge was called 'Ocean Gardens'.The purpose of our project was to educate the importance of Oceans 
and its services in our lives through pictures or videos in an interactive way.Made by a 6 members team in the 48hrs hackathon.
I worked on the page climate.html and its corresponding CSS. This page has a quiz made with JavaScript.

            <p>
                Climate is the long-term pattern of weather conditions in any 
                particular place. Climate affects all life in our planet in every way. 
                Climate change affects the social and environmental 
                determinants of health - clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter. 
                The potential future effects of global climate change include more frequent wildfires, longer periods 
                of drought in some regions, and an increase in the wind intensity and 
                rainfall from tropical cyclones. It has a huge effect on our livelihoods, our health, and our future.

                    <p class="description"> The majority of radiation from the Sun is absorbed by 
                    the ocean, particularly in tropical waters around the equator, where the ocean 
                    acts like a massive, heat-retaining solar panel. Land areas also absorb some 
                    sunlight, and the atmosphere helps to retain heat that would otherwise quickly 
                    radiate into space after sunset.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="description">Evaporation helps to distribute heat around the globe. When water molecules are heated,  
                        they exchange freely with the air in a process called evaporation. Ocean water is constantly 
                        evaporating, increasing the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air to form rain and 
                        storms that are then carried by trade winds. Almost all rain that falls on land starts 
                        off in the ocean. The tropics are particularly rainy because heat absorption, and thus ocean 
                        evaporation, is highest in this area.

                    <h3 class="ptitle">Ocean current as a conveyor belt
                    </h3>
                    <p class="description">Currents are movements of ocean water in a continuous flow, created largely 
                        by surface winds but also partly by temperature and salinity gradients, Earth’s rotation, and 
                        tides. Major current systems typically flow clockwise in the northern hemisphere and 
                        counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere, in circular patterns that act much like a conveyor belt, 
                        transporting warm water and precipitation from the equator toward the poles and cold water 
                        from the poles back to the tropics. Ocean currents help to counteract the uneven distribution of solar 
                        radiation reaching Earth’s surface.

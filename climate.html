      <h2 >How important is Climate in our lives?</h2>
      <p>
        Climate affects nearly every aspect of our lives, from our food sources to our transport infrastructure, from what clothes we wear, to where we go on holiday. It has a huge effect on our livelihoods, our health, and our future. Climate is the long-term pattern of weather conditions in any particular place.Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health â€“ clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter.

                <p class="ptitle">Solar radiation</p>
                <p class="description"> majority of radiation from the Sun is absorbed by the ocean, particularly in 
                tropical waters around the equator, where the ocean acts like a massive, heat-retaining solar panel. 
                Land areas also absorb some sunlight, and the atmosphere helps to retain heat that would otherwise 
                quickly radiate into space after sunset.

                <p class="description">helps to distribute heat around the globe. When water molecules are heated,  
                    they exchange freely with the air in a process called evaporation. Ocean water is constantly 
                    evaporating, increasing the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air to form rain and 
                    storms that are then carried by trade winds. In fact, almost all rain that falls on land starts 
                    off in the ocean. The tropics are particularly rainy because heat absorption, and thus ocean 
                    evaporation, is highest in this area.</p>
